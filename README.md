genomics using convolutional networks" *PNAS* published online March 12, 2018 ahead of print https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1717139115](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/03/09/1717139115).

We provide scripts for formatting and analyzing data, a portable Docker container that encapsulates a executable software, documentation, and data used to generate the results shown in the paper.
